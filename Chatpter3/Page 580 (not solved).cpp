/*
Task: Longest Palindromic Subsequence
Write a program to determine the length of the longest subsequence of a given string s that is a palindrome.
The subsequence does not need to contain consecutive characters of the string, but they must appear in the same order
(a subsequence is obtained by deleting an arbitrary number of characters).

Input: A string s composed only of lowercase English letters is read from standard input, with a maximum length of 5000 characters.

Output: Print only the required length of the longest palindrome subsequence.

Example
Input
najduzipalindrom

Output
5
