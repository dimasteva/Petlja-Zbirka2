Task: Sum of Minimums  
Write a program that determines the sum of the minimums of all non-empty subarrays of a given array of integers.  
Input: The standard input provides the number `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), followed by `n` elements of the array (numbers between 0 and 10^5, each separated by a space).  
Output: Since the sum can be large, print its remainder when divided by one billion and seven (10^9 + 7) to the standard output.

Example 1:  
Input  
3  
1 3 2  
Output  
10  
Explanation  
The non-empty subarrays are [1], [1, 3], [1, 3, 2], [3], [3, 2], and [2]. Their minimums are 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, and 2, respectively, and the sum of these minimums is 10.

Example 2:  
Input  
7  
4 3 2 1 2 3 4  
Output  
48  

Example 3:  
Input  
7  
1 2 3 3 3 2 1  
Output  
49
