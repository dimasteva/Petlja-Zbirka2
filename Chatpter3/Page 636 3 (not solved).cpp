/*
Task: Converting a fully parenthesized expression to postfix form  
Write a program that converts a valid infix arithmetic expression with parentheses around each application of a binary operator into postfix form. For simplicity, assume that all operands are single-digit numbers and that only addition and multiplication operations are used.  
Input: A single line of standard input contains a valid, fully parenthesized expression.  
Output: Print the desired postfix form to standard output.  
Example  
Input  
(((3*5)+(7+(2*1)))*4)  
Output  
35*721*++4*
