Task: Longest Segment Containing Consecutive Numbers  
In an array of distinct integers, find the length of the longest segment (consisting of consecutive elements of the array) that contains numbers that can be arranged into a sequence of consecutive integers.  
Input: The first line of standard input contains the number of elements in the array n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000), followed by the next n lines containing the elements of the array in order.  
Output: On standard output, print the length of the longest segment whose elements can be arranged into a sequence of consecutive integers.
