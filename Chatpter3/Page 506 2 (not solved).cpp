Task: Nearest Pair of Points
In the given set of points in the plane, determine the distance between the two points that are closest to each other.
Input: The standard input consists of the number of points n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50000), followed by the coordinates of the points in the next n lines (two integers between −109 and 109, separated by a space).
Output: Print the requested distance to the standard output, rounded to five decimal places.
