Task: Value of the min-max expression  
Expressions are built from digits, parentheses, and two infix operators. The operator `m` denotes finding the minimum of two numbers, and `M` denotes the maximum of two numbers. The operator `M` has a higher precedence. Write a program that calculates the value of the given expression.  
Input: The input consists of a single expression of the described form (in one line, without spaces).  
Output: Output the value of the given expression.  
Example 1  
Input  
3m4M5  
Output  
3  
Example 2  
Input  
((((9M1)M(0m6)m0M0)m0M6m(9m1M3m(4m(6m8))))M8M5)m(1M2M(0m6))  
Output  
2  
Example 3  
Input  
7  
Output  
7
