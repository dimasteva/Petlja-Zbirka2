Task: Value of min-max expression

Expressions are built from digits, parentheses, and two infix operators. The operator 'm' denotes finding the minimum of two numbers, while 'M' denotes finding the maximum of two numbers. The 'M' operator has a higher priority. Write a program that calculates the value of the input expression.

Input: The input consists of an expression in the described format (in a single line, without spaces).

Output: Print to the standard output the value of the input expression.

Example 1:
Input
3m4M5
Output
3

Example 2:
Input
((((9M1)M(0m6)m0M0)m0M6m(9m1M3m(4m(6m8))))M8M5)m(1M2M(0m6))
Output
2

Example 3:
Input
7
Output
7
