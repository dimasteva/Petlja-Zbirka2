Task: Prime Factors 235  
Consider a sequence of numbers whose prime factors are only 2, 3, and 5 (each factor can appear zero or more times). These numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, … Write a program that determines the n-th element of this sequence (counting starts from 0).  
Input: A number n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10000) is read from standard input.  
Output: Print the requested n-th element of the sequence to standard output.
