Task: Transporting items by elevator

In front of an elevator with a known carrying capacity, there are items with known masses. Write a program that determines the minimum number of trips required to transport all the items.

Input: From the standard input, the number of items n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) is read, followed by the masses of the items (integers between 1 and 50), and finally, the elevator’s carrying capacity (an integer between 50 and 120).

Output: On the standard output, print the required number of trips.
