Task: Powers of Natural Numbers  
Consider a series of numbers that are powers of natural numbers (with the base and exponent strictly greater than 1), sorted in ascending order. Its initial part is as follows: a₀ = 4 = 2², a₁ = 8 = 2³, a₂ = 9 = 3², a₃ = 16 = 4² = 2⁴, a₄ = 25 = 5², a₅ = 27 = 3³, a₆ = 32 = 2⁵, and so on. Write a program that determines the element aₖ.  
Input: The number k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10⁶) is read from standard input.  
Output: Print the element aₖ on standard output.  
Example 1
