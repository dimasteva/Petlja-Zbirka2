A string contains, among other characters, small brackets (( and )), but it's possible that they are not correctly paired. The goal is to delete as few characters as possible from the string to obtain a string with correctly paired brackets. Write a program that prints all possible strings with correctly paired brackets obtained by deleting as few characters as possible.

Output: Print all the requested strings in lexicographical order.

Example 1
