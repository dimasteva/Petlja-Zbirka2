Task: Triminos
Given an 8 × 8 board with one missing square, the task is to fill the remaining 63 squares with triminos (shapes formed by removing one square from a 2 × 2 square).
Input: Two integers between 0 and 7, separated by a space, representing the coordinates (row and column) of the missing square on the board are read from standard input.
Output: Print a character matrix representing the board covered with triminos. A space should be printed in the position of the missing square, and different characters (for example, lowercase English letters) should be used to represent the triminos. The solution is not unique.
