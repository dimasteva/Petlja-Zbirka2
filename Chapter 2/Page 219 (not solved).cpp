/*
Task: Maximum Segment Sum with Fixed Start
Given an array of integers of length n, for a fixed left endpoint 0 ≤ i < n, find the minimum sum of the form ai + ai+1 + . . . + aj, where i ≤ j < n. Write a program that reads the array and then various starting values i, outputting the corresponding maximum sum for each starting point.

Input: The standard input first reads a number n (3 ≤ n ≤ 105), followed by n elements of the array separated by spaces. After that, it reads a number of queries q (1 ≤ q ≤ 105), followed by q natural numbers i (0 ≤ i < n), separated by spaces.

Output: For each entered value of i, print the corresponding maximum sum on a separate line of standard output.

Example
Input
5
3 -1 4 -3 2
3
0 2 3
Output
6 4 -1
