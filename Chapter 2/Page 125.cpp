/*
Task: Squares

Given a set of points in the plane, write a program that determines how many different squares can be formed with all four vertices belonging to this set of points.

Input: The standard input first reads an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), followed by the coordinates of n points in the next n lines (first x, then y, separated by a single space).

Output: Print on the standard output the requested number of squares.

Example:
Input
7
-1 1
0 1
1 1
-1 0
0 0
1 0
0 -1
Output
3
