Task: Harmonic Pi
The sum

\[ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k}{2k + 1} = 1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{11} + \ldots \]

is equal to \( \frac{\pi}{4} \). Write a program that, for the given \( n \), estimates the value of \( \pi \) by calculating the first \( n \) terms of the previous sum. Then, show how the value changes by varying the number of terms, displaying the sum values for each number of terms from 1 to \( n \).
Note that this is a very poor method for estimating the value of \( \pi \), as you will see, it requires a large number of terms to approach the actual value of \( \pi \).
