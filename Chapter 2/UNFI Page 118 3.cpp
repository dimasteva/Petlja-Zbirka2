Task: Correct Phones
A sequence of phone numbers is correct if no number is a prefix of another (meaning there are no two identical numbers in the sequence). Write a program that determines whether the input sequence of numbers is correct.

Input: The standard input provides the number of phone numbers, n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50000), followed by n lines containing n phone numbers. Each number consists of between 3 and 50 digits.

Output: Print "da" if the sequence is correct, i.e., "ne" if it is not.
