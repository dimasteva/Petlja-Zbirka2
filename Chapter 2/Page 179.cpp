/*
Task: Duplicates

Let's assume that internet addresses are represented by natural numbers (IP addresses, for example, are stored as unsigned 32-bit integers).
A browser keeps a list of all addresses that the user has visited during some previous period. The user has visited many addresses multiple times. Write a program that determines the number of different addresses the user has visited.

Input: Enter from the standard input the number n (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 105), and then n natural numbers (less than 232), each on a separate line.

Output: Print to the standard output the number of different addresses the user has visited.

Example:
Input
8
123456789
234567890
345678901
234567890
456789012
234567890
456789012
234567890

Output
4
